# TNT Core (Tangle) - Audit Rules

FOCUS:
- Solidity security patterns
- Reentrancy vulnerabilities
- Access control (onlyOwner, roles)
- Integer overflow/underflow (pre-0.8 patterns)
- Gas optimization
- Upgrade patterns (proxy safety)
- Event emissions for off-chain indexing
- Storage layout for upgradeable contracts

IGNORE:
- **/node_modules/**
- **/artifacts/**
- **/cache/**
- **/typechain-types/**
- **/*.test.sol
- **/test/**
- **/script/**

STRICT:
- Reentrancy without checks-effects-interactions
- Missing access control on sensitive functions
- Unchecked external calls
- tx.origin usage
- Delegatecall to untrusted contracts
- Hardcoded addresses without constants
- Missing zero-address checks
- Storage collisions in proxies

CONTEXT:
Tangle Network core protocol contracts.
Solidity-based, likely using Foundry or Hardhat.
Security-critical: handles staking, slashing, operator registration.
Upgradeable contracts - watch for storage layout issues.
